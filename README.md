## 1. Background
This project entails implementing a program that will solve arbitrary tiling puzzles. The purpose of this project is to introduce a rich branch of discrete mathematics / combinatorics that involves tilings, symmetry, counting, solution space searching, branch-and-bound pruning, etc.

## 2. Puzzle Introduction
An interesting set of puzzles consists of pieces corresponding to the twelve "pentominoes" (i.e., all of the 12 non-isomorphic combinations of five connected unit squares).
